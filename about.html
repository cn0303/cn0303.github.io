            <p>Chandran N is a Masters student at TU Delft. He has been involved in public speaking for over 10 years now. He has participated in various elocution competitions, debates, MUNs and other oratory events and learnt what works and what doesnt. He decided to start these classes by observing massive defeciencies in the usual way public speaking is taught. This led him to come up with a tried and tested method to help people upskill fast. Two cohorts have already benefited greatly from his classes.</p>
